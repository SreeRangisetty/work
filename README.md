Title:To-Do-List Application

Description-keyfeatures:

Due Date: Users can set a specific due date for each task. This helps in scheduling and managing deadlines effectively.

Priority Levels: Tasks can be assigned priority levels such as Low, Medium, or High. This helps in organizing tasks based on their urgency or importance.

Category: Ability to categorize tasks into different groups or categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Errands). This assists in sorting and filtering tasks for easier navigation.

Task Status: Tasks can be marked with statuses like New (just created), In Progress (actively being worked on), or Completed (finished tasks). This allows users to track the progress of each task.

Title and Description: Each task should have a title for quick reference and a detailed description to provide context, instructions, or additional information regarding the task.

Local Storage: The app utilizes local storage capabilities to save tasks.

However, syncing capabilities with a cloud service for backup or cross-device access could be a valuable addition.
